# Importance of Measurement Uncertainties in Ichnology

An often-ignored, complicating factor in quantitative ichnological 
analyses is that all physical measurements have associated uncertainties. 
Such uncertainties allow researchers to specify precision for their 
measurements as well as calculated quantities with the use of error 
propagation. It is impossible to quantify comparative disagreements in their 
absence, which are necessary for classification and categorization. They also 
provide a mathematically rigorous way to reject outlying data. Exclusion of 
data without such rigor is scientific negligence, which introduces unnecessary 
interpretation biases in the results. Measurement uncertainties provide 
even more value when the uncertainties are not uniform within a measurement 
sample, which is often true in ichnology due to variability in track 
preservation.

Using *** we investigate how the inclusion of measurement uncertainties
impacts the data


Standard statistical methods are, by definition, valid under specific 
assumed conditions. If these conditions are not met for a given data 
set, the data set must be analyzed using different methods or the 
results will be incorrect. 




There are two such conditions that are potentially impacted by 
preservation variability. The first is the condition of normality. 
The distribution for a given ensemble of measurements must be roughly 
normal, i.e. Gaussian. The second is the condition of uniformity of 
relative uncertainties. Common statistical techniques assume that each
measurement in an ensemble is known to roughly the same extent and 
does not require any kind of weighting. 

We investigate to what extent, if any, these conditions are violated 
on a large ichnological data set to determine broadly applicable 
results for the field. 

The A16 data set is an excellent source for this investigation as it 
consists of a large number of measurements acquired in a consistent 
fashion that describe a diverse range of source material. 

_They cover a variety of track sizes, substrates, ... 
(insert  geological and paleontological information here)._ 

We will use the term measurement ensemble to describe a group of 
measurements that will be operated on using statistical methods as a 
set. Calculating the mean width for all left pes tracks within a 
trackway would be an example. The widths of each track make up a 
measurement ensemble for which the statistical mean will be calculated.
Throughout this investigation we will be using $$ m_i $$ to denote a 
measurement in the measurement ensemble $$ M $$.
