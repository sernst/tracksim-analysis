Coupling Length Sampling
========================

Given that Coupling Length (CL) is a continuous function of progress within
a trackway simulation, its value can be sampled at any arbitrary point 
during a gait cycle. The problem with doing so is that, depending on the gait,
there may be times where the CL measurement is not valid. In this investigation
we will explore CL under various conditions to ascertain a sampling rate that
is universally valid among gaits.
