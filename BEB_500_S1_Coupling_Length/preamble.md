BEB 500 S1
==========

A comparative investigation of coupling lengths from tracksim gait simulations 
of BEB 500 S1.

The following table outlines the simulation trials of BEB 500 S1. Gaits are
uniquely identified in terms of their gait ID and separation value. The table
has been sorted by median coupling lengths for each trial.
