The first of the two graphs above plots the coupling length data, with 
uncertainty, for each gait trial that was simulated. The amount of overlap
gives a good indication of the potential variation in gaits.

The second plot shows the fractional coupling length uncertainties for each of
the trials above, in the same order. Here you can see that the fractional 
deviations (fractional Median Absolute Deviations) decrease as the coupling
length increases. In isolation, this plot suggests that the longer coupling
length trials have a higher solution fitness. 

It would be interesting to run these trials on even larger gaits to see if the 
trend continues, or if there is some other trend that appears in a larger 
separation, even if it's unlikely that those longer coupling-length gaits are
physically reasonable solutions.

The problem with the information provided in the graphs above is that they are
statistical and tend to smooth over transient deviations in the trackway 
simulations.
