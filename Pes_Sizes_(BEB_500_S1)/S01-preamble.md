Pes Dimensions for BEB 500 S1
=============================

Analysis of the pes dimensions for the BEB 500 S1 trackway. The following
table contains the width and length information for of the tracks in the
S1 trackway as well as the Cadence reference identifiers and fingerprints
for the tracks.

Table columns conform to a naming convention that starts with the letter 'l' or
'r' to indicate the left or right lateral location of the limb. Following is
another letter 'm' or 'p' for manus or pes and then an underscore character.
The letters after the underscore indicate what type of information is being
stored:

 * **w:** width
 * **dw:** uncertainty in width
 * **l:** length
 * **dl:** uncertainty in length
 * **name:** Cadence track fingerprint
 * **uid:** Cadence reference unique identifier
 * **track:** Track reference number from the field measurements. For 
    example, if a track was named LP-11, the track value will be the 
    numeric portion of the name, in this case 11.

Tracks for different limbs are not grouped together by row in a meaningful way.
The columns for each limb are filled from top to bottom in trackway order
without reference to the other limbs. Given that not all limbs have the same
number of tracks, NAN values are found in cells once all tracks have been
populated for a particular limb.
