Coupling Length
===============

Consider a perfectly regular quadrupedal trackway of arbitrary unit stride 
lengths and an arbitrary gauge (left and right side separation). The manus 
tracks are placed such that they appear "ahead" of the pes tracks in a 
commonly observed arrangement as shown below:

Add four foot position locators in the trackway. Each one represents the 
position of one of the trackmaker's feet projected into the plane of the 
trackway. The position of each locator depends upon the choice of gait and
duty cycle.
