Idealized Coupling Investigation
================================

A group of scenarios was run on simulated data for a range of 
print intervals 0, 25%, 50% and 75% for two different duty cycles of
60% and 75%. Each group contained the standard set of gaits. The 
collection trials from all of these simulations has been loaded into
this notebook for analysis.
